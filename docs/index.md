## Cheat Sheet

**Create a *.fw file from local repo (RPi Zero):**

```sh
NERVES_SYSTEM=farmbot_system_rpi MIX_TARGET=rpi mix deps.get
NERVES_SYSTEM=farmbot_system_rpi MIX_TARGET=rpi mix firmware
sudo fwup farmbot_os/_build/rpi/rpi_dev/nerves/images/farmbot.fw
```

**Create a *.fw file from local repo (RPi v3):**

```sh
NERVES_SYSTEM=farmbot_system_rpi3 MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix deps.get
NERVES_SYSTEM=farmbot_system_rpi3 MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix firmware
sudo fwup farmbot_os/_build/rpi3/rpi3_dev/nerves/images/farmbot.fw
```

**Create or Update the Nerves System:**

Please see the official [Nerves documentation on "Nerves Systems"](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/0.4.0/systems.html).

HINT: You may want to [develop the system locally](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28189056/1064917)
